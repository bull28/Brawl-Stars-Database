FRANK API Changes

Make sure to run the script again!

Resource icons moved from misc/ -> resources/

/collection

New field: completedBrawlers: Number
Number of brawlers the user has all pins unlocked for.

Future addition: collectionScore
This will show a letter grade for the user's collection, describing how close they are to completion.
This grade will also determine the color of the user's icon border.

/login

New field: tokensEarned: Number
The amount of tokens the user has collected by logging in. If some time has passed since their last login,
the user should receive some tokens. All new users receive some free tokens on their first login.


New endpoint: /brawlbox

Request:
{
    "token": String,
    "boxType": String
}

	- The boxType field tells the API which type of box to open. If no boxType is specified or an empty
	  string is given, a list of available boxes will be returned in the format
	  {"<boxType1>": {"cost":Number,"image": String}, "<boxType2>": ...}
	- The <boxType> value is the ID of the brawlbox which can be send in the boxType field to open that type of box.
Response:
[
    {
        "displayName": String,
        "rewardType": String,
        "amount": Number,
        "image": String,
        "backgroundColor": String
    }
    ... 1 object for each item
]

	- All calculations are done internally before the response is sent. The response is made entirely for the user
	  and nothing needs to be sent back to the API.
	- The response contains the information that should be displayed to the user based on the contents of the box.
	- rewardType is an ID for the type of reward given. This should not be displayed to the user and instead, it
	  can be used by the website to do similar actions on the same types of rewards.
