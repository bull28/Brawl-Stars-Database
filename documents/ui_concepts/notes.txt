General
- Feel free to change any colors to whatever you want. For the rest of the concepts, any exceptions (colors which are not
supposed to be changed) will be listed.
- "Coming Soon" buttons will eventually be renamed and have their own menu.

Events Menu

Main Page
- When the events menu is opened up, a screen similar to events_main_page.png will be displayed.
- This page will display events at a specific time. The user can decide what time they want to display events at, using
the menu on the left.
- The colors of the events should be the ones provided from the API. The field "backgroundColor" should be used for the
background of the currently active event. The field "textColor" should be used for the text which displays which event is
starting next.
- There are 4 ways of choosing a time: Current, Season Time, and World Time. The circles to the left of them
indicate a multiple choice menu. Only one option can be chosen at a time.
- The "Update" button refreshes the timers on the events. If the web page is able to refresh automatically without much delay,
this button can be removed.

Map Search Page - example in map_view.png
- This page will allow the user to view the image of a specific map.
- There will be a box where the user can enter a search query. Once the user starts the search, all the maps which match their
search will be displayed.
- Clicking on a map from the search results will open a pop-up which contains information about the map.
- If there is exactly one search result, the pop-up automatically opens without the user needing to click on a map.
- In the pop-up, the image of the map is displayed, as well as the time until the map will appear next.

Optional: Full map rotation screen - refer to map_rotation_page.png
- Accessed from the Events Menu, Main Page
- Displays the full map rotation in a similar format to a calendar application.
- The user can scroll down the page to view more maps (the entire image will not be on the screen all at once).
- A thin line indicates the current time.

Brawler Page - example in brawler_view.png
- Move portrait and description to the left side.
- Move 3D model to the center. The 3D model viewer's window size should be the same aspect ratio on all brawlers.
- Add a section showing the brawler's available pins to the right side.
- Add a button next to any skins which have a 3D model available. Clicking this button switches the model in the 3D viewer
to that skin's model. All default skins have a 3D model, so clicking the button next to the default skin switches the model
back to the default.
- Skins which are limited should have a golden (or any other special color) border.
- Fix some free skins being displayed as default skins.
- Move the skin image background to the center of the box.

User Accounts - this explains how the website should work, endpoint descriptions are in account_endpoints.txt
- This feature allows users to collect brawlers and pins and store them in an account.
- There should be a login/signup button which redirects the user to the login page. Here are two ways that it can be done:
	- Add an "Accounts" button to the bottom-middle purple button on the main menu. This opens a page where accounts can
	  be managed. Log in, sign up, and view account status on this page.
	- Add a "Log in" button to the top-right of the screen which opens a pop-up where the user enters their credentials.
	  Once they are logged in, their username is displayed in the top-right corner and the "Log in" button changes to a
	  "Log out" button.
- Once the user is logged in, they are able to access certain features of the website which are only availble to users who are
logged in.
- If a user is not logged in and attempts to access one of these features, the page should not open. Alternatively, the user
could be redirected to the login page.
- If a user is logged in, their username should be displayed somewhere on the screen. Also, a logout button should be near
their username and/or the login button.

Brawler and Pin Collection Page - example in collection_page.png
- The user must be logged in to access this page. It can be accessed through their account page.
- All brawlers and pins that can be collected will be shown on this page. Those which the user has not collected yet will be
grayed out.
- The bottom half of the page contains tiles with brawler portraits and names. The tiles also show how many pins have been
collected for that brawler.
- Clicking on a brawler's portrait will redirect the user to that brawler's page.
- A brawler's pins are hidden by default, but can be shown by clicking the down arrow on the bottom-right corner of their box.
- On this page, the user can also open Brawl Boxes. Clicking on a box with sufficient resources will open the box and show
the user what rewards they received.

Trading Page - example in trades_page.png
- This page can be viewed without logging in. However, in order to perform any actions, the user needs to log in.
- The main trades page will display all the trades currently active with 20 per page. If there are performance issues, this
amount can be decreased.
- There are various sorting methods and filters that the user can use to find what they are looking for:
	- The sorting method controls how the returned results are ordered. There are currently 4 options: newest first
	  (default), oldest first, most expensive, and least expensive.
	- The filters control which results are returned and which are not. The user can choose only to see trades which
	  include a specific brawler.
	- To narrow results even further, the user can choose to only see trades with a specific pin they may be looking for.
	- The "Apply to:" option controls whether the filters affect the offer or the request. For example, one may choose
	  apply to offer if they are looking for a specific pin. One use for apply to request may be if someone really wants
	  to get rid of that Darryl pin and wants to see if anyone wants it.
- Once the user selects their desired sorting and filters, the refresh button will update the list of trades. If the user
changes the page number, the list is updated immediately.
- The user's relevant resources are displayed at the top of the screen.

User Trades
- There should exist a page where the user can view their own active trades. This information is available by using the
search by username endpoint.
- The search by username feature can also be used to get a list of another user's trades.

Creating Trades - example in trades_create.png
- On the user trades page, there will be a button to create a new trade. This opens up an interface where the user can select
which pins they want to include in the trade.
- One way of allowing the user to add pins is having their collection on the screen in a compact format and they can drag and
drop pins from their collection into either of the two sides of the trade.
- If dragging and dropping is not possible, another way is to have a "+" button on each of the two sides of the trade.
Clicking the "+" button will open a pop-up which lists all the user's brawlers and pins, similar to the way they are listed
in the collection page, except more compact. They can then click on pins in this pop-up to add them to the trade.
- If the user makes a mistake and wants to remove a pin, there is a "X" button on each pin they have added.
- To adjust the copies of each pin in the trade, make it so either the user can click on the number to edit it or the user
chooses how many copies they want to add when adding the pin.

Accepting Trades - example in trades_confirm.png
- Clicking on a trade preview will open a pop-up which serves as a confirmation for the trade. Example in trades_confirm.png.
- If the user is not logged in at this point, replace the confirm button with a log in button.
- When the user clicks on the confirm button, the trade will be validated. If it is successful, the pins which the user
received will be displayed to them. If unsuccessful, an error will be displayed.

Closing Trades
- If a user clicks on a trade from the main trading page or the user trades page which they created, instead of the confirm
button, a close button will be displayed.
- If the trade has not yet been accepted or has expired, the close button will cancel the trade and refund all pins and trade
credits. In this case, the close button should read "Cancel".
- If the trade has been accepted by another user, the close button will claim the rewards then remove the trade. In this case,
the close button should read "Claim".
- When trades are accepted, pins the creator requested are not immediately added to their collection. Only the acceptor
will receive their pins at that moment.
- When the creator logs in, they have to manually claim their trade. This is the case because there may be conflicts with
locked brawlers which require the user's input to resolve.
- When closing a trade, display the pins the user received.
