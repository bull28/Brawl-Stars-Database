General
- Feel free to change any colors to whatever you want. For the rest of the concepts, any exceptions (colors which are not
supposed to be changed) will be listed.
- "Coming Soon" buttons will eventually be renamed and have their own menu.

Events Menu

Main Page
- When the events menu is opened up, a screen similar to events_main_page.png will be displayed.
- This page will display events at a specific time. The user can decide what time they want to display events at, using
the menu on the left.
- The colors of the events should be the ones provided from the API. The field "backgroundColor" should be used for the
background of the currently active event. The field "textColor" should be used for the text which displays which event is
starting next.
- The banners of the events should be available in the API soon.
- There are 4 ways of choosing a time: Current, Upcoming, Season Time, and World Time. The circles to the left of them
indicate a multiple choice menu. Only one option can be chosen at a time.
- The Current, Upcoming, and Season Time choices are already supported by the API. If you are able to accept a date and time
and convert it to "seconds after January 1, 1970", then the World Time option can be added.
- The "Update" button refreshes the timers on the events. If the web page is able to refresh automatically without much delay,
this button can be removed.
- The "Search for a specific map" button will redirect the user to the Map Search Page.

Map Search Page
- This page will allow the user to view the image of a specific map.
- By default, all the maps in the game will be displayed in the search result box. There is currently not a feature in the
API which provides all the maps, but one should be added soon.
- If the user wishes to do so, they can narrow their search by game mode by checking the boxes on the left. Unlike the
multiple choice option on the Main Page, this page allows the user to select more than one choice.
- Clicking on a map will open up a pop-up which displays the image of the map as well as the time until it appears next.
Refer to event_popup.png to see an example of this. If the pop-up is not possible, redirect the user to a new page containing
the pop-up's content.
