General
- Feel free to change any colors to whatever you want. For the rest of the concepts, any exceptions (colors which are not
supposed to be changed) will be listed.
- "Coming Soon" buttons will eventually be renamed and have their own menu.

Events Menu

Main Page
- When the events menu is opened up, a screen similar to events_main_page.png will be displayed.
- This page will display events at a specific time. The user can decide what time they want to display events at, using
the menu on the left.
- The colors of the events should be the ones provided from the API. The field "backgroundColor" should be used for the
background of the currently active event. The field "textColor" should be used for the text which displays which event is
starting next.
- There are 4 ways of choosing a time: Current, Season Time, and World Time. The circles to the left of them
indicate a multiple choice menu. Only one option can be chosen at a time.
- The "Update" button refreshes the timers on the events. If the web page is able to refresh automatically without much delay,
this button can be removed.

Map Search Page - example in map_view.png
- This page will allow the user to view the image of a specific map.
- There will be a box where the user can enter a search query. Once the user starts the search, all the maps which match their
search will be displayed.
- Clicking on a map from the search results will open a pop-up which contains information about the map.
- If there is exactly one search result, the pop-up automatically opens without the user needing to click on a map.
- In the pop-up, the image of the map is displayed, as well as the time until the map will appear next.

Optional: Full map rotation screen - refer to map_rotation_page.png
- Accessed from the Events Menu, Main Page
- Displays the full map rotation in a similar format to a calendar application.
- The user can scroll down the page to view more maps (the entire image will not be on the screen all at once).
- A thin line indicates the current time.

Brawler Page - example in brawler_view.png
- Move portrait and description to the left side.
- Move 3D model to the center. The 3D model viewer's window size should be the same aspect ratio on all brawlers.
- Add a section showing the brawler's available pins to the right side.
- Add a button next to any skins which have a 3D model available. Clicking this button switches the model in the 3D viewer
to that skin's model. All default skins have a 3D model, so clicking the button next to the default skin switches the model
back to the default.
- Skins which are limited should have a golden (or any other special color) border.
- Fix some free skins being displayed as default skins.
- Move the skin image background to the center of the box.

User Accounts - this explains how the website should work, endpoint descriptions are in account_endpoints.txt
- This feature allows users to collect brawlers and pins and store them in an account.
- There should be a login/signup button which redirects the user to the login page. Here are two ways that it can be done:
	- Add an "Accounts" button to the bottom-middle purple button on the main menu. This opens a page where accounts can
	  be managed. Log in, sign up, and view account status on this page.
	- Add a "Log in" button to the top-right of the screen which opens a pop-up where the user enters their credentials.
	  Once they are logged in, their username is displayed in the top-right corner and the "Log in" button changes to a
	  "Log out" button.
- Once the user is logged in, they are able to access certain features of the website which are only availble to users who are
logged in.
- If a user is not logged in and attempts to access one of these features, the page should not open. Alternatively, the user
could be redirected to the login page.
- If a user is logged in, their username should be displayed somewhere on the screen. Also, a logout button should be near
their username and/or the login button.

Brawler and Pin Collection Page - example coming soon
- The user must be logged in to access this page. It can be accessed through the "Gallary" button.
- All brawlers and pins that can be collected will be shown on this page. Those which the user has not collected yet will be
grayed out.
- Clicking on a brawler will redirect the user to that brawler's page.
